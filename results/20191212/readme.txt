analyse cell homeostasis models again
hypothesis: IL2 model can lose stability under some conditions, e.g. a perturbation or activating stimulus, IL7 model is robust under all circumstances
to show this, I need to plot heatmap IL7 or IL2 params vs beta prolif with sensible vmin vmax. vmax needs to be in instable region for IL2 params.
hypothesis2: timer model can confer robustness to the halftime and halflive, this could be also checked in the literature in these parameters vary. In IL7 model beta prolif has strong effect on this.
