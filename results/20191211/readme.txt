change how the loss of feedback effect in branching model depends on branching probability
show that branching and comp. model are the same for default conditions but then vary
change the current implementation of precursor model to have functional probabilities p1 and p2
in case with only one fb I can add one dummy parameter p so that p=prob1*beta2/(beta1*(1-prob1) where prob1 is eff. probability and prob1 \in (0,1) and prob1(IFN)
