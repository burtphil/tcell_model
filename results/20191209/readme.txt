test different models of proliferation contraction
in this case, if carrying capacity is reached cells switch to apoptosis pathway prolif rate decreases exponentially

plot model readouts vs parameter changes
plot heatmaps 
plot time courses for different scenarios

for low prolif rates IL2 model buffers better than carrying capacity
for high prolif rates IL7 model works better
timer model good in all cases (timer model also more robust with regard to tau?)
